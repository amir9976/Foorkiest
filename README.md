I started Foorkiest project because I love food. I am passionate about finding new recipes and sharing them with friends. Foorkiest is the perfect way to discover new recipes and share your favorites with your friends. With a super easy-to-use interface, you can find recipes quickly and save them for later. Plus, you can upload your own creations! 

## Tech Stack

HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript (ES6)

**Design Tool:** Figma

**Build Tool:**  Parcel


## Project Summary

In this stage I employed modern, and semantic HTML5 coupled with SCSS using the 7-1 pattern.

I also utilized the most recent JavaScript (ES6) and an object-oriented approach to develop the application using MVC architecture for this project.

I also dived deep into the asynchronous aspects of JavaScript promises, async/await and error handling. 

I used them to access data from third party API using AJAX calls.

Moreover I utilized NPM, Parcel (module bundler).

## Roadmap

During this phase I underwent four stages in order to have a clear grasp and understanding of the project. Stage 1: Familiarizing myself with the company. Stage 2: Competitor Analysis Stage 3: Branding Analysis Stage 4: Ux Overall Questions. The final outcome of the process was a comprehensive and clear understanding of the company and the audience of the project. 

In this phase, I analyzed the entire design using a bird's-eye view in order to better understand the pattern of components as well as typography, colors, and other crucial information to gain a thorough view of the project prior to begin with the write code. In this phase, I gather all images, text, icons and other resources to help the project succeed.
